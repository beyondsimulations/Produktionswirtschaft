# Produktionswirtschaft

This repository contains teaching materials for the course "Produktionswirtschaft 2" at the University Duisburg-Essen. I am stepping in to teach this course for a single academic year as a short-hand replacement. The course materials and structure are thus somewhat preliminary. The course focuses on Time Series Analysis and Production Planning techniques. All materials are in German.

## Course Overview

The course is structured in six modules:

1. **Forecasting and Exponential Smoothing** - Introduction to time series prediction methods
2. **Time Series Analysis** - Advanced techniques using Holt/Winters and regression models
3. **Employment Smoothing and Production Planning** - Core concepts of production management
4. **Resource Planning and Scheduling** - Optimizing resource allocation
5. **Sequence Planning** - Determining optimal production sequences 
6. **Exam Preparation** - Practice problems and comprehensive review

## Course Structure

Each of the first five sections consists of:
- Lecture slides (originally by Prof. Manitz)
- Practical tutorials with hands-on exercises
- Code examples and case studies

The final section is dedicated to exam preparation with practice problems and Q&A.

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of operations research and modeling concepts
- Familiarity with statistical methods
- Basic programming knowledge (recommended but not required)
